The numerical difference between two elements as written in the text rules.  It is the right-most column in a HintsTable and should be the sort key to ease algebraic type discoveries.In the HintsTable, the offset sign must be explicitly specified as unsigned offsets are offsets for which the direction in unknown. Offsets of unknown sign are also called delta clues and cannot be used by the processor  for algebraic discoveries until sign is know (only useful to derive RestrictedValues at the onset).e.g. Mrs Choir's evening out is one day before or one day after Mrs Haddad's
