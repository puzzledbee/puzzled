A table used to capture relationship between items that have a mathematical expression such as equal, less than, more than, n less than, n more than, unequal (where n is called offset.  Once captured in the HintsTable, new relationships can be discovered using one of the three algebraic method discovered (see LogicElements).  A HintsTable looks like:SerialText Clueunknow_xcategory_xitem_xunknow_ycategory_yitem_yoffseta.1.leverssprings5pulleyscheesegorgonzola0b.2.leverspulleys5pulleyscheeselimburger0c.3.leverscheesetilsitpulleyssprings40d.4.leverscheeselimburgerpulleyslevers30e.1.springscheesegorgonzolaspringscheesecamembert+1f.2.springspulleys5springscheesewensleydale+1g.3.springscheesetilsitspringslevers4+1h.4.springslevers2springspulleys3+1This sample above is derived from the text clues of ~PennyPress Original Logic Problems Mar 1999 - Whodunit Part 2: The Big Cheese (problem 24)As a convention the offset is defined as what x has over yThe HintsTable need not to be sorted by offset value but it makes the discovery of new algebraic relationships much easierThe text clue number may not be necessary. We may consider a Investigate mode that, on hover, points to a Clue glyph.What about unknown offsets (e.g. A's older than B).... should they go into the HintsTable?
