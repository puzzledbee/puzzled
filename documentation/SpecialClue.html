Contrary to a normal clue, a special clue is a text clue that needs to be reassessed periodically because it does not, at the onset, provide sufficient information to determine VALUE_YES relationships.
*e.g. Annabel's baby is two pounds lighter than Briana's baby. 
Note however that some special clue such as the example above implies immediate VALUE_NO relationships consisting of extremes and possibly further restricted values as the puzzle solving progresses. Other special clues such as Or clues may not lead to any immediate relationship, but will once a clause has been proven true or false.Other interesting examplesXor sets (... , ... , ... ) are different peopleAlternatives form 1
