Next chunks:action list and rollback (undo enabled for constraints only)ctrl+enter in clue barNLP processingTiddlers tagged "todo":Clue NumberingRollBackIssues:issue with transpose examining category pairs multiple times through the double for loop; fixed with the category pair TreeSet which includes each pair only once. Does that need to be applied to the other logic elements?issue with loading a 2nd lpf file over a first one. The problem does not show until refreshing.binding the value of the GridCell to that of its linked Relationship does not appear to be sufficient. At least changing the GridCell's value upon the user setting a Constraint achieves the "synchronization" of the GridCell<->Relationship values that is pretty important. However, the fact that the Relationship was set as a constraint is lost.one could add a new bound property that is the logicType that is also set when the context menu is used for constraintsone could instead call a setter method on the Relationship which passes value and LogicTypethe method publicvoidsetValue(ItemPairpair,ValueTypevalue,LogicTypearg_logicType,Dependable...arg_predecessors) seems to already have this 'feature' ?!the fact that Relationship objects are not aware of what items they relate to, it makes it difficult to log information about user interactionitem pair information could be passed to the object during construction, and the toString method could be used to output meaningful informationthe method publicvoidsetValue(ItemPairpair,ValueTypevalue,LogicTypearg_logicType,Dependable...arg_predecessors) seems to get pair info during value being set ?!a utility function could be used to find the Relationship object in the RelationshipTable and retrieve its pair informationNext::
