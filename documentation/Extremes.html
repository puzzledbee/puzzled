A type of RestrictedValues determined when items in numerical-like categories are compared with one another. Extremes are computed easily from the HintsTable at the beginning of the puzzle solving process.  The offset values are important because 'offset' positions from each of the elements in the equation are 'taken out' such that:the lower element will see the 'offset'-highest values 'taken-out'the higher element will see the 'offset'-lowest values 'taken-out'e.g. A's baby is two (note that the offset is 2) pounds lighter than B's baby, where the weight items are 6,7,8,9,10 pounds, means that A's baby (the lower element) cannot be 9 or 10 pounds and that B's baby (the higher element) cannot be 6 or 7 pounds.
