<p>A type of RestrictedValues determined when items in numerical-like categories are compared with one another. Extremes are computed easily from the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#HintsTable">HintsTable</a> at the beginning of the puzzle solving process.  The offset values are important because 'offset' positions from each of the elements in the equation are 'taken out' such that:</p><ol><li><ol><li>the lower element will see the 'offset'-highest values 'taken-out'</li><li>the higher element will see the 'offset'-lowest values 'taken-out'</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li>e.g. A's baby is two (note that the offset is 2) pounds lighter than B's baby, where the weight items are 6,7,8,9,10 pounds, means that A's baby (the lower element) cannot be 9 or 10 pounds and that B's baby (the higher element) cannot be 6 or 7 pounds.</li></ul>
