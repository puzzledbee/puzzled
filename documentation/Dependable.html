Interface against which comply all objects which can be used to infer Relationship, such as a Clue, a Constraint, a Hint, and a Relationship. For example, if a user clicks the grid and sets a constraint to VALUE_YES, the Cross can be filled out using VALUE_NO which depend on the VALUE_YES relationship. The first relationship itself depends on the constraint.Dependable methods (bundling both methods needed for successors and predecessors):center position of associated graph element (GridCell for Relationship, Clue glyph, or Hint identifier.)What is the best data structure for dependencies? 
Each Relationship will need to maintain a HashSet<Dependable> of predecessors (derived from); Relationship and Hint will both need to have an HashSet<Dependable> of successors (impacting), with a view to avoid walking through the RelationshipTable when needing to recursively invalidate a set of relationships after an undo operation (or constraint change).See InvestigateItemPossible PredecessorsPossible SuccessorsClueRelationship/HintHintHint/ClueRelationshipConstraintRelationshipRelationshipConstraint/Clue/Hint/RelationshipRelationship
