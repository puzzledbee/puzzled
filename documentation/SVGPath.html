When using the -fx-shape CSS attribute for a label, coordinates become very difficult to grasp. The approach is therefore ill-suited for Label decoration alone, without a StackPane or AnchorPane.
Observation:a Move statement to start is absolutely necessarythe maximum size of the path string (outer bounds) will be scaled down to fit the node dimensions, no matter what values are chosenit is near impossible to define a path that does not somehow anchor to the edges, unless you draw invisible parts in three of 4 corners to set the boundary of the SVG pathat best you will be able to shrink down the visible boundaries of a label, and fill it with the label background. Best to overlay/anchor a smaller Shape (with a simpler SVG path defined) on top of the Label if you can afford it.
