Early experiments indicate that FAXB can be used to marshall the LogicProblem object to file and unmarshall the object from file.
Some observations:Objects needing unmarshalling need to have a public default constructor with no argument definedThere are some default XmlElements that are added without the need to annotate them with @XmlElement. It is not clear which are default and which need annotation. For example, a publicdouble get/set gets marshalled without annotation, whereas a publicint get/set does not ?!!?The default names assumed and marshalled are the XX in the public getXX() method, not the name of the private field and or private Property field?!?!?It may be necessary to remove an annotation from the private fields if the matching getXX() method becomes added by default, to remove duplicationSome private fields can be annotated, but Property objects cannot; instead annotate the getXX method and if a setXX method is also present, the Property will be restored upon unmarshallingThere seems to be no issue annotating private List<Object> fields, and if the Object is also annotated, it will also be marshalled/unmarshalled.I find it easier annotating fields than the matching getXX method. After all, the purpose of the marshalling process is to save the fields of the object to disk.You can change the order of the output of the fields in the XML file using the @XmlType(propOrder={"name","type","items"}) annotation, but every element needs to be accounted for in the list (source of many stack traces)Use the @XmlTransient for fields/methods who should not be marshalledFAXB marshalling/unmarshalling demo
