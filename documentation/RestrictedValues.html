<p>Restricted values are values that are impossible for a certain item in a certain category because of the text clues that have been provided.  It includes first and foremost the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Extremes">Extremes</a> when items are compared quantitatively in numerical-like categories, but may also include other values depending of the relationship between items.</p><ul><li>The HintsTable is the primary tool to identify restricted values and must be reassessed frequently to 'take out' impossible values that have crept up by VALUE_NO or VALUE_YES relationships in the grid.</li><li>It's like a special bond created between two value bubbles in the grid.  The hints table reassessment ensures the bond is respected when there are changes in either set (bubble) of elements.</li><li>Additionally, some restricted values appear based on the oddities in the value sets:<ul><li>e.g. months be Apr Jun Jul Aug, the fact that May is missing could exclude potential values from an unknown if A is one month earlier than B, A can't be Apr and B can't be Jun. The extremes also prevent A from being Aug and B from being Apr.</li><li>e.g. A's pulleys are equal to B's levers, pulley items being 1,3,4,5,6 and lever items being 1,2,3,4,5.  Neither can be 2 or 6.</li></ul></li><li>Mathematical equations such as less than, double, half also result in restricted values.</li></ul>
