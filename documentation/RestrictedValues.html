Restricted values are values that are impossible for a certain item in a certain category because of the text clues that have been provided.  It includes first and foremost the Extremes when items are compared quantitatively in numerical-like categories, but may also include other values depending of the relationship between items.The HintsTable is the primary tool to identify restricted values and must be reassessed frequently to 'take out' impossible values that have crept up by VALUE_NO or VALUE_YES relationships in the grid.It's like a special bond created between two value bubbles in the grid.  The hints table reassessment ensures the bond is respected when there are changes in either set (bubble) of elements.Additionally, some restricted values appear based on the oddities in the value sets:e.g. months be Apr Jun Jul Aug, the fact that May is missing could exclude potential values from an unknown if A is one month earlier than B, A can't be Apr and B can't be Jun. The extremes also prevent A from being Aug and B from being Apr.e.g. A's pulleys are equal to B's levers, pulley items being 1,3,4,5,6 and lever items being 1,2,3,4,5.  Neither can be 2 or 6.Mathematical equations such as less than, double, half also result in restricted values.
