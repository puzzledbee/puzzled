users should be able to buy problems or problem albums, or subscribe to automatically receive albums as they become availablethe app should have a library that shows the purchased  and available albumsas users attempt solving puzzles,they can save and resume their problemsan album could be a a compressed archive of .lpf files (.lpz), encrypted (AES) with a symmetric key shared via pki (ECDSA) (see truevfs.java.net)maybe the key pair can be generated when the app is installed and the public key is sent back to the server, then used to send symmetric key backthe all would periodically poll the server to see if pr-paid albums are releasedthe server would keep track of subscriptions for customers and generate encrypted bundles for subscribers with public keys, which apps will fetchsubscriptions can only be handled through web but maybe a browser can be includedthe application will be associated with an account using the email and password through a crypto hash?each time the application is registered, account info (hash) is saved on the device and a key pair is generated.–The public key is then sent up to the server with the subscribees credential hash whereas – the private key is saved along side the account info.The server tracks the number of public keys each account has. When downloading magazines, the client requests by submitting its public key, then if needed a new symmetric key is encrypted with the public key and sent back. The server encrypts the magazines based on valid entitlements, using the new key and makes  then available to the client.can the server generate the fly or does the client have to wait and ask again???  requests submit the public key and creds hash
