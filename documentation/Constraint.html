A Constraint is a relationship type created through graphical user interaction, by right-clicking a GridCell. Logically, constraints are no different than relationships derived from clues. As they are actions from the user, Constraints are undoable, unlike other relationships shown, derived from clues directly or through the processor logic.When saving an .lpf file, relationships set with a LogicType of CONSTRAINT are added to the list of clues as clues of type CONSTRAINT in a simple item1 is [not] item2. When a logic problem is loaded, clues of type CONSTRAINT will be left off the clue list (and glyph box), but will be parsed into relationships just like normal clues would be.GridCell's context menu should offer set as positive, set as negative or clear (the latter should result in RollBack). However, the application should gray out menu item that result in conflict with earlier / uptree relationships (e.g. can't set as positive or clear a cell that already has been set to VALUE_NO through deduction. => maybe the underlying data structure should maintain a mutable state, which is only true if the relationship was set as a constraint, that is graphically?
