<p>A <strong>Constraint</strong> is a relationship type created through graphical user interaction, by right-clicking a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#GridCell">GridCell</a>. Logically, <strong>constraints</strong> are no different than <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Relationship">relationships</a> derived from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clues</a>. As they are actions from the user, <strong>Constraints</strong> are <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#RollBack">undoable</a>, unlike other relationships shown, derived from <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clues</a> directly or through the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Processor">processor</a> logic.</p><p>When saving an <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#.lpf">.lpf</a> file, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Relationship">relationships</a> set with a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#LogicType">LogicType</a> of <strong>CONSTRAINT</strong> are added to the list of clues as <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clues</a> of type <strong>CONSTRAINT</strong> in a simple <em>item1 is [not] item2</em>. </p><p>When a logic problem is loaded, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clues</a> of type <strong>CONSTRAINT</strong> will be left off the clue list (and glyph box), but will be parsed into <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Relationship">relationships</a> just like normal <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clues</a> would be.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#GridCell">GridCell</a>'s context menu should offer <code>set as positive</code>, <code>set as negative</code> or <code>clear</code> (the latter should result in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#RollBack">RollBack</a>). However, the application should gray out menu item that result in conflict with earlier / uptree relationships (e.g. can't set as positive or clear a cell that already has been set to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#VALUE_NO">VALUE_NO</a> through deduction. =&gt; maybe the underlying data structure should maintain a mutable state, which is only true if the relationship was set as a constraint, that is graphically?</p>
