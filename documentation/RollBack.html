Ability to undo any action previously taken by the user. Actions are limited to Constraints and Clues. This will be invoked by clearing a previously set Constraint or deleting a previously entered Clue.One approach could be to remove all Relationship successors of the Clue|Constraint object being cancelled, as well as those successors, recursively. This could be accomplished by:extensive relationship dependency management; which is more or less required anyways to be able to trace how the software applieds its logica sequence number given to actions and relationshipsAnother approach could be to remove the Clue|Constraint and re-compute from the topThe EnableDisableTextClues feature feels like a RollBack / RollForward feature....See also Undo.Relationships that are not manually entered, such as those derived from text clues or using any of the logic elements, cannot be modified by the user using the Graphical User Interface.In order to achieve roll-back, a Sequencer object needs to exist and its current value needs to be assigned to each relationship.
