Type of text clue which enumerates a list of elements.  The elements in the enumeration are independent and cannot be associated together.e.g. The four mothers are: Lucie, the one who dresses in blue, the one who eats cake and the one whose baby weights 9 pounds.In the example, the following six VALUE_NO relationships need to be captured:Lucie does not wear blueLucie does not eat cakeLucie's baby does not weight 9 poundsThe mother who dresses in blue does not eat cakeThe mother who dresses in blue does not have a 9-pound baby, andThe mother who eats cake does not have a 9-pound baby.Mathematically, the number of VALUE_NO relationships is equal to the triangular number of (items enumerated-1), so in the example: T(4-1) = 3 + 2 + 1, only if all element of the Enumeration are from different categories. A counter example would beThe four mothers are: Lucie, the one who eats carrots, the one who eats cake and the one whose baby weights 9 pounds.Lucie does not eat carrotsLucie does not eat cakeLucie's baby does not weight 9 poundsThe mother who eats carrots does not have a 9-pound baby.The mother who eats cake does not have a 9-pound baby.Also note the existence of relative enumerations when one of the enumerated item depends on another item.e.g. The four mothers were: Wendy, the one who married Phillip, the one named Mrs Courts and the one who married two months before Mrs CourtsWendy didn't marry PhillipWendy is not Mrs CourtsWendy did not marry two months before Mrs CourtsThe mother who married Phillip didn't marry two months before Mrs Courtslater on, this clue should help infer who married two months before Mrs Courts.Enumerations could potentially be solved by building a list of possible items for each of the elements according to a chosen category (to be examined: does building a list of possible items for each of the enumerates according to more than one category help??)e.g. (if listed according to the first name category) the elements become:WendyEither Jessica, Lucie or BrendaEither Lucie or BrendaEither Lucie or Brenda (thus Jessica married Philip)
