<p>Type of text <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clue</a> which enumerates a list of elements.  The <strong>elements</strong> in the enumeration are independent and cannot be associated together.</p><ul><li>e.g. <em>The four mothers are: Lucie, the one who dresses in blue, the one who eats cake and the one whose baby weights 9 pounds.</em></li><li>In the example, the following <strong>six</strong> <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#VALUE_NO">VALUE_NO</a> relationships need to be captured:</li></ul><ol><li><ol><li>Lucie does not wear blue</li><li>Lucie does not eat cake</li><li>Lucie's baby does not weight 9 pounds</li><li>The mother who dresses in blue does not eat cake</li><li>The mother who dresses in blue does not have a 9-pound baby, and</li><li>The mother who eats cake does not have a 9-pound baby.</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li>Mathematically, the number of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#VALUE_NO">VALUE_NO</a> relationships is equal to the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_numbers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">triangular number</a> of (items enumerated-1), so in the example: T<strike>(4-1)</strike> = 3 + 2 + 1, only if all element of the <strong>Enumeration</strong> are from different categories. A counter example would be<ul><li><em>The four mothers are: Lucie, the one who eats carrots, the one who eats cake and the one whose baby weights 9 pounds.</em></li></ul></li></ul><ol><li><ol><li>Lucie does not eat carrots</li><li>Lucie does not eat cake</li><li>Lucie's baby does not weight 9 pounds</li><li>The mother who eats carrots does not have a 9-pound baby.</li><li>The mother who eats cake does not have a 9-pound baby.</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li>Also note the existence of <strong>relative enumerations</strong> when one of the enumerated item depends on another item.<ul><li>e.g. <em>The four mothers were: Wendy, the one who married Phillip, the one named Mrs Courts and the one who married two months before Mrs Courts</em></li></ul></li></ul><ol><li><ol><li>Wendy didn't marry Phillip</li><li>Wendy is not Mrs Courts</li><li>Wendy did not marry two months before Mrs Courts</li><li>The mother who married Phillip didn't marry two months before Mrs Courts</li><li>later on, this clue should help infer who married two months before Mrs Courts.</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li>Enumerations could potentially be solved by building a list of possible items for each of the elements according to a chosen category (to be examined: does building a list of possible items for each of the enumerates according to more than one category help??)</li><li>e.g. (<em>if listed according to the first name category</em>) the elements become:<ul><li>Wendy</li><li>Either Jessica, Lucie or Brenda</li><li>Either Lucie or Brenda</li><li>Either Lucie or Brenda (thus Jessica married Philip)</li></ul></li></ul>
