Ordered list of nice-to-have features:should find a way to inspect a Relationship and view arrows to the parent dependencies (predecessors)... and also show all the relationships that depend on it (successors)... Best if those dependencies also track and indicate the type of Logic Element used to derive it (perhaps with a colour code, when presented visually)hints -> application provides hints when Automatic Processing is not enabledRollBack and Undo for constraints and clueswhen loading a problem from file, it would be interesting to have the option to step through processing of clues, or have it automatically process everything (Preferences)Android version (see http://ladstatt.blogspot.ca/2016/02/fx-tictactoe-deploy-javafx-app-into.html)internationalization support, particularly for UI and Ordinalsautomatic discovery of SpecialCategory types based on list of known words, but users will be able to force ordinals if words are not known from a list. The list should be in a text file with headings such as [weekdays] that match the category types and a different text file can be generated for each languageimproved validation on unmarshalling XML filesFXLauncher for automatic app update https://github.com/edvin/fxlauncheraim to automatically recognize special categories automatically when entering items, and prompt user to validateauto-complete when entering clues, based on recognized items or category names (see TextField from ControlsFX)Completed featuresnotification pane for errorsreset problem where the clues and constraints are removed but categories and items remain, akin to starting the problem overprint API to print the grid with or without the Relationship, with or without labelsprovide a .lps file format used to rapidly input problemsset/change category or item labels from the Grid using Lightweight dialogsprovide zoom in/zoom out capability (see example in Mastering... p.48) using buttons on the top left of the Grid (see Layout)mnemonic and shortcut keys for menu itemsprovide tool tipspackage some sample problem files with the .jar file and extract them from the .jar file when the application is launchedAbandonned featuresadd look and feel options or skins....
