<p>It is probably a good idea to break up long clues into multiple ones using NLP sentence detection. This will allow the entire clue text to be pasted in at once maybe? The original clue number probably needs to be retained and internally, clues will have to use numbering such as 1.1, 1.2, 2.1....
(think through complex clues with brackets or commas; maybe chunking</p><p>Part of speech tagging helps identifying sentence components and is probably sturdier than building a token finder by hand; however, it does not provider context such beyond relative or superlative (ie. no indication whether it is generally &gt; or &lt;). This means a subsequent word match will have to focus on the JJR, JJS tags to figure the mathematical relationship.... :( - lemmatization may help abstract out tenses plurals, maybe even direction/delta?</p><p>For complex item or category names, there are two approaches that could work; replace them before POS tagging with something that will avoid a POS tagging of each token within the item or category name (e.g. remove all the space, or replace with item11, category8 then the rest of the logic can hone in on the other POS tags); however it is hard to force the POS tagger and there could be collisions with tags we need to interpret..... Alternatively, we could let the POS tagger do its thing and try to look past/ignore the tags we don't need to interpret....</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.baeldung.com/apache-open-nlp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apache OpenNLP tutorial</a></p>
