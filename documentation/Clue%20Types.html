The basic categories of clues for the software are as follows:NormalClue - directly leads to relationship(s) and requires no further reassessmentSpecialClue - may directly lead to relationship(s) but needs further reassessment.  The majority of text clues provided in logic puzzles will be in this form simply because it is more challenging, and NormalClue don't constitute much of a puzzle.Also follows a list of particularly interesting clues found in published logic puzzles.  They most often represent a challenge from a parsing/programming perspective and need to be considered during puzzled's development.Gender - when text clues restrict possible values by considering the gender of first namesLength of item - when the text clues restrict possible values based on the length of the item word itselfNumericalElements - when the items in a category need to be considered numerically for comparison/computation purposesCategoryRules - when rules are specified between entire categories rather than between items.  Categories eligible for CategoryRules are often but not always considered by their numerical values (see NumericalElements)Enumeration - technique which consists in of listing multiple elements using distinguishing attributes.
