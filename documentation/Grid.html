Grid is a visual container of the category and item labels as well as the data structure of GridCell.
It needs not to be part of the LogicProblem class, but can be generated upon loading/creating by the application.(see UI Container Hierarchy)Grid node hierarchy:AnchorPane, in grid tabStackPane (mainStack)layer 1, AnchorPane (mainGrid)Button zoomIn, anchored top leftButton zoomOut, anchored top leftScrollPane, anchored top left, on top (mainScroll)Group (BorderPane's center region) (used to enable zoom in / zoom out) (mainGroup)Grid extends StackPane (subject to ScaleX and ScaleY....) (logicProblemGrid)layer 1, AnchorPane (gridPane), for the gridlayer 2, AnchorPane (labelPane), for labels (visibleProperty bound to CheckMenuItem)layer 3, AnchorPane (relationshipPane), for relationships (GridCells)  (visibleProperty bound to CheckMenuItem)HBox for the clue glyphs, anchored bottom rightHBox for the hint glyphs, anchored bottom rightlayer 2, AnchorPane, for the dependencies (needs to be above the Grid StackPane in the ScrollPane, to show arrows to the glyphs)To draw the grid:gridmaxwidth=(numCategories-1)*numItems*cellwidth
gridmaxheigth=(numCategories-1)*numItems*cellheight
