Special case of SpecialCategory in which there is a mathematical relationship between items or the numerical representation of textual items (e.g. days of the week):software needs to know if the value of the item is important for the deductions, or simply the position of the item in the category (or should it always treat numerically if the clues use the items as such?)an option is to consider all numerical values as meaningful, but the user would need to know not to enter these items textually, which is counter intuitive for rankings such as first, second, third, fourth, fifth (would have to be entered 1,2,3,4,5)any numerical item is subject to a set of mathematical expressions such as +,- but also the less common *,/ :eg. the weight of John's parcel is twice as heavy as the weight of Lucie's parcel.
* pay special attention to problem 5 (Dress Design) of the Pocket Puzzles Logic Puzzle 1 booklet which uses positional information (could it be handled as a normal category with less than / greater than??)
* the months of the year and the days of the week need to be considered as numerical values as it leads to eliminations of values
