This tiddler describes the various logic elements used by puzzled.Constraintentered graphically by the user using the Graphical User Interface, can be captured as a simple text clue.From Cluedetermined by the parser from the text enteredCrossfor VALUE_NO relationships onlystems from the discovery/entering of a VALUE_YES relationship and is represented graphically by a crossUniquenessstems from (numberItems-1) VALUE_NO relationships in a category, which automatically identify the left-out item as the VALUE_YESTransposedreplicating known relationships on either side of a VALUE_YES to ensure graphical/geographical consistencyCommonalityused when the only possible values share a commonality.e.g. Paul lives in either the yellow or blue house, but both the yellow and blue house cannot be where the cat lives, therefore Paul does not have a cat.when searching for Commonality relationships, examine when there are 2 to numberItems-2 possible values (thus not possible if numItems <=3). Restricted valuesderived from special clues, values that are impossible for an element because two numerical elements are used in an algebraic-like equation which causes incompatible valuesincludes deltas until sign is determined, then processed via the Hints Table.Algebraicrelationship derived mathematically using the HintsTableThree types of algebraic processes have been discovered: Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3.EnumerationVALUE_NO relationship discovered following the elimination of options as part of an enumeration.
