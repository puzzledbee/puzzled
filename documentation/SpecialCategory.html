Some categories are unusual and need specialized handling. Namely:Mathematical categories (or NumericalElements), or categories in which items have a mathematical relationship between one another, which is used in the puzzle clues (items can be unevenly spaced as in the examples given):numerical: agequantities (2,3,5,6,7)years (1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996)office/house numberprices (various currencies)weightscore/markspercentagetimes: e.g. 8:15, 8:45, 9:45, 10:15, 10:45subject to next day calculation in some problems (00:30 is an hour after 23:30)ordinals:textual items for which there is a mathematical relationship between the numerical representation of the itemsdays: e.g. Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday (needs to be interpreted as 1-7 correctly)subject to optional wrap-around in some problems; if the days are not fixed in time, arguably, Sunday can be the day after Saturday.months: e.g. January, March, June, July, August (needs to be converted to 1-12 correctly)subject to optional wrap-around in some problems; if the months are not fixed in time, arguably, January can be the month after December.ranks: e.g. lieutenant, captain, lieutenant-colonel, generalranking: first, third, fourth, fifth, sixthdates: 14 July, 17 August, 18 November, 1 December, ...text properties of the item used in cluesword length  (e.g. name with 7 letters)word spelling repeating items:within a category (e.g. two students prefer blue, two prefer red, and two prefer orange)across categories (e.g. pet's names & owner's names have the same items)relationship across categories (e.g. both animals and parcels have weights and a clue reads like Lucie's dog weights twice as much as the parcel given to Paul)a combination of typese.g. (mathematical & repeating items) two of the cost items are equal at $80, two other equal at $90, two other equal at $100.e.g. (relationship across categories & text properties) dog's name's first letter is not the same as the owner's name's first letterFor many of these special categories, it seems the best approach is to maintain a "shadow" value property (in addition to the text property), which is used for computations. A translator will convert the text of the item into a mathematical entity. The shadow value could be generated once and stored, or computed on the fly each time it is needed.
