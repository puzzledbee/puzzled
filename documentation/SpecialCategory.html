<p>Some categories are unusual and need specialized handling. Namely:</p><ul><li>Mathematical categories (or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#NumericalElements">NumericalElements</a>), or categories in which items have a mathematical relationship between one another, <strong>which is used in the puzzle <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clues</a></strong> (<strong>items can be unevenly spaced as in the examples given</strong>):<ul><li><strong>numerical</strong>: <ul><li>age</li><li>quantities (2,3,5,6,7)</li><li>years (1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996)</li><li>office/house number</li><li>prices (various currencies)</li><li>weight</li><li>score/marks</li><li>percentage</li></ul></li><li>times: e.g. 8:15, 8:45, 9:45, 10:15, 10:45<ul><li>subject to next day calculation in some problems (00:30 is an hour after 23:30)</li></ul></li><li><strong>ordinals</strong>:textual <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Item">items</a> for which there is a mathematical relationship between the numerical representation of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Item">items</a><ul><li>days: e.g. Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday (needs to be interpreted as 1-7 correctly)<ul><li>subject to optional wrap-around in some problems; if the days are not fixed in time, arguably, Sunday can be the day after Saturday.</li></ul></li><li>months: e.g. January, March, June, July, August (needs to be converted to 1-12 correctly)<ul><li>subject to optional wrap-around in some problems; if the months are not fixed in time, arguably, January can be the month after December.</li></ul></li><li>ranks: e.g. lieutenant, captain, lieutenant-colonel, general</li><li>ranking: first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth</li></ul></li><li>dates: 14 July, 17 August, 18 November, 1 December, ...</li></ul></li><li>text properties of the item used in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">clues</a><ul><li>word length  (e.g. name with 7 letters)</li><li>word spelling </li></ul></li><li>repeating items:<ul><li>within a category (e.g. two students prefer blue, two prefer red, and two prefer orange)</li><li>across categories (e.g. pet's names &amp; owner's names have the same items)</li></ul></li><li>relationship across categories (e.g. both animals and parcels have weights and a clue reads like Lucie's dog weights twice as much as the parcel given to Paul)</li><li>a combination of types<ul><li>e.g. (mathematical &amp; repeating items) two of the cost items are equal at $80, two other equal at $90, two other equal at $100.</li><li>e.g. (relationship across categories &amp; text properties) dog's name's first letter is not the same as the owner's name's first letter</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>For many of these special categories, it seems the best approach is to maintain a &quot;shadow&quot; value property (in addition to the text property), which is used for computations. A translator will convert the text of the item into a mathematical entity. The </strong>shadow<strong> value could be generated once and stored, or computed on the fly each time it is needed.</strong></p>
