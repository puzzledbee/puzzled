<p>Feature which will help understand where any given relationship in the grid comes from (by showing arrows to other <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dependable">Dependable</a> objects.</p><p>For example when investigating, hovering over a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#GridCell">GridCell</a> could show arrows to other <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#GridCell">GridCells</a> or <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">Clue</a> indices in the bottom-right of the grid.</p><p>Do we want to turn on investigating mode which would then allow you to click and show all dependencies at once? Or only one cell at a time by right click? Or hover long enough on a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#GridCell">GridCell</a> to show only its dependencies?</p>
