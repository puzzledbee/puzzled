Design considerations:use modern JavaFX components for the user interfaceuse as much FXML for the "static" application shell (menu, Tabs, status bar, Clue text field, etc, and Java code to draw the Grid / Answers) as possibleuse cascading stylesheets (CSS) extensively, which makes it simpler to customize the appearanceuse a modern data structure from the Java Collections Framework for the RelationshipTableuse lambda expressions for event handling, because the code is cleaner and shorteruse Java bindings extensively between application objects and UI elements. Bindings save a lot of event handling code.use powerful Java enums to describe attributes whenever possiblekeep as little as possible in the LogicProblem class, –which is serializable and– used for saving/loading the problem to file/from file. The RelationshipTable, HintsTable, etc. can be re-generated. Aim to save the LogicProblem as an XML file which will make it easier for power users to rapidly create problems, and (also opens the door to a command line interface in addition to the GUI, automated Processor testing,etc). Consider FAXB for XML binding.keep ordinals (months, days) text in a text file for each language. Entries should be in the right order so that numerical rules can be appliedtry to keep classes small; however find a reasonable way to pass object pointers between classes for necessary application context informationlog plenty, use modern flexible logging frameworkprovide modern notifications (e.g. file saved successfully) framework, such as using popover...See also Features
