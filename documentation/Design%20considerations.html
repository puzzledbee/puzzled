<p>Design considerations:</p><ul><li>use modern JavaFX components for the user interface</li><li>use as much FXML for the &quot;static&quot; application shell (menu, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Tabs">Tabs</a>, status bar, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Clue">Clue</a> text field, etc, and Java code to draw the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Grid">Grid</a> / <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Answers">Answers</a>) as possible</li><li>use cascading stylesheets (CSS) extensively, which makes it simpler to customize the appearance</li><li>use a modern data structure from the Java Collections Framework for the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#RelationshipTable">RelationshipTable</a></li><li>use lambda expressions for event handling, because the code is cleaner and shorter</li><li>use Java bindings extensively between application objects and UI elements. Bindings save a lot of event handling code.</li><li>use powerful Java enums to describe attributes whenever possible</li><li>keep as little as possible in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#LogicProblem">LogicProblem</a> class, –which is serializable and– used for saving/loading the problem to file/from file. The <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#RelationshipTable">RelationshipTable</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#HintsTable">HintsTable</a>, etc. can be re-generated. Aim to save the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#LogicProblem">LogicProblem</a> as an XML file which will make it easier for power users to rapidly create problems, and (also opens the door to a command line interface in addition to the GUI, automated <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Processor">Processor</a> testing,etc). Consider FAXB for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#XML%20binding">XML binding</a>.</li><li>keep <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#SpecialCategory">ordinals</a> (months, days) text in a text file for each language. Entries should be in the right order so that numerical rules can be applied</li><li>try to keep classes small; however find a reasonable way to pass object pointers between classes for necessary application context information</li><li>log plenty, use modern flexible logging framework</li><li>provide modern notifications (e.g. file saved successfully) framework, such as using popover...</li></ul><p>See also <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Features%20(Wish%20List)">Features</a></p>
